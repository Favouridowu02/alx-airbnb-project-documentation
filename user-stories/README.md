# Airbnb Clone – User Stories Directory

This directory contains user stories for the Airbnb Clone project. User stories are concise, user-centered descriptions of desired system functionality, written from the perspective of the end user or stakeholder. They are essential for guiding feature development, prioritizing tasks, and ensuring the system meets user needs.

## Purpose

The user stories in this directory are derived from the Airbnb Clone use case diagram and cover all major functionalities for Guests, Hosts, and Admins. These stories help the development team understand what users want to achieve and why, providing a foundation for:

- Feature planning and implementation
- Acceptance criteria for testing
- Communication between developers, designers, and stakeholders
- Agile sprint planning and backlog grooming

## Structure

- `user-stories.md`: Contains a comprehensive list of user stories, organized by user role (Guest, Host, Admin) and system module (e.g., Search & Filter, Booking Management, Payment System, etc.).

## How to Use

1. **Reference for Development:** Use these user stories to guide the implementation of features and ensure all user needs are addressed.
2. **Acceptance Criteria:** Derive acceptance tests and criteria from each user story to validate feature completion.
3. **Backlog Management:** Add, update, or remove user stories as requirements evolve or new features are proposed.
4. **Stakeholder Communication:** Share these stories with stakeholders to confirm that the system aligns with business goals and user expectations.

## Example User Story Format

Each user story follows the format:

> As a [user/role], I want to [do something] so that [I achieve some value].

For example:

> As a guest, I want to filter properties by price so that I can stay within my budget.
