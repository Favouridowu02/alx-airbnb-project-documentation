## Introduction
The Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust property booking platform similar to Airbnb. The project emphasizes backend systems, database design, API development, and application security. It enables learners to understand complex architectures, workflows, and collaborative team dynamics while building a scalable web application.

## Project Overview
- **Goal:** Build a web-based application that replicates core Airbnb functionalities, focusing on user registration and property booking.
- **Scope:** This version covers user registration, authentication, property listing, and booking management.
- **Stakeholders:** Developers, software architects, system designers, and end users.

## Functional Requirements
1. The system shall allow users to create an account using email and password.
2. The system shall allow users to log in and log out securely.
3. The system shall allow users to list properties for booking.
4. The system shall allow users to browse and search available properties.
5. The system shall allow users to book available properties.
6. The system shall prevent double-booking of properties for overlapping dates.
7. The system shall allow users to view their booking history.
8. The system shall allow property owners to manage (add, edit, delete) their listings.
9. The system shall send confirmation emails upon successful registration and booking.

### Example API Endpoints
- `POST /api/register` — Register a new user
- `POST /api/login` — Authenticate user
- `GET /api/properties` — List all properties
- `POST /api/properties` — Add a new property
- `POST /api/bookings` — Book a property
- `GET /api/bookings` — View user bookings

## Non-Functional Requirements
- The system shall respond to user actions within 2 seconds under normal load.
- All sensitive data shall be encrypted in transit and at rest.
- The application shall be available 99.9% of the time.
- The system shall be scalable to support increasing numbers of users and properties.
- The system shall provide clear error messages and validation feedback.

## Constraints
- The backend must be developed using Flask.
- The database must use MySQL.
- The system must comply with relevant data protection and privacy regulations.

## Assumptions
- Users will have a stable internet connection.
- Property data provided by owners is accurate and up-to-date.

## Dependencies
- MySQL database
- Redis for caching
- AWS S3 for file storage
- Django and related Python libraries

## Acceptance and Performance Criteria
- A user can successfully register, log in, and log out.
- A user can list, browse, and book properties without errors.
- Double-booking of properties is prevented.
- Confirmation emails are sent for registration and bookings.
- All API endpoints return appropriate status codes and error messages.
