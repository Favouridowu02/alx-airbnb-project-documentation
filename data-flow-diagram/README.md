## Purpose

The DFD helps developers, designers, and stakeholders understand the flow of information within the Airbnb Clone system. It is useful for:
- Visualizing system architecture
- Identifying key processes and data stores
- Communicating requirements and design
- Supporting database and API design

## Main Modules & Entities

### Modules
1. **Payment Management**: Handles all payment-related processes and interacts with the User Database.
2. **Booking Management**: Manages property bookings for guests and hosts, storing booking data in the database.
3. **User Management**: Manages user registration, authentication, and profile updates.
4. **Notification**: Sends notifications to users about important events (e.g., booking confirmations, payment status).
